Form validation is the process of verifying the user's input data on the server-side to ensure that the data provided is accurate, complete, and valid. In NodeJS, there are many ways to perform form validation, including using built-in modules like 'express-validator' and 'joi.'

Using the 'express-validator' module, developers can define validation rules for each input field in the form, and then check these rules in the request body using middleware. The middleware checks whether the input data complies with the validation rules or not and returns an error message if there is an issue with the input data.

On the other hand, the 'joi' module offers a simple and expressive way to define validation rules. Developers can create a schema for the input data that defines the expected format, data types, and validation rules. Then, they can use the validate function to check the request body against the defined schema.

By using these modules, developers can ensure that the user's input data is clean, safe, and meets the defined criteria, thereby preventing potential security vulnerabilities and improving the overall user experience.
